# WebRTC Chat Application

## 📖 Overview
This project is a **real-time video and text chat application** built using **WebRTC** and **WebSockets**.  
It demonstrates peer-to-peer (P2P) communication where users can connect, exchange text messages, and initiate video calls directly in the browser — without relying on third-party services.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **WebRTC** – for real-time peer-to-peer audio, video, and data communication.  
- **WebSockets** – for signaling and bidirectional communication between client and server.  
- **Node.js** and **Express.js** – for backend signaling server implementation.  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – for frontend UI and WebRTC integration.

## 🧠 Understanding WebRTC and WebSockets

| Feature | **WebRTC** | **WebSocket** |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Primary Use** | Real-time audio/video (P2P) | Real-time data exchange (client-server) |
| **Communication Model** | Peer-to-Peer | Client-to-Server |
| **Best For** | Video calls, voice chat, low-latency streaming | Chat, notifications, real-time updates |
| **Performance** | Optimized for media streams | Efficient for text/binary data |
| **Signaling** | Requires separate signaling (often via WebSocket) | Can handle signaling itself |
| **Security** | Built-in end-to-end encryption | Security depends on WSS (over HTTPS) |

WebRTC and WebSockets are often **used together** —  
- **WebSockets** handle signaling (call setup, connection messages).  
- **WebRTC** handles the actual **audio/video and data** transmission directly between peers.  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. A user joins the app and connects to the **WebSocket signaling server**.  
2. The signaling server exchanges connection details (SDP and ICE candidates) between peers.  
3. **STUN/TURN servers** help establish connections across different networks.  
4. Once connected, **WebRTC** transmits live audio/video and chat messages directly between users.

---

## 🧩 Core Components
### 1. Signaling Server (WebSocket)
Handles connection requests and relays SDP and ICE candidates between users.

```js
// server.js (simplified)
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', socket => {
  socket.on('message', message => {
    // Broadcast signaling data to other peers
    wss.clients.forEach(client => {
      if (client !== socket && client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(message);
      }
    });
  });
});

2. WebRTC Peer Connection (Client)

Establishes direct peer-to-peer communication.

// client.js (simplified)
const peer = new RTCPeerConnection();

navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true })
  .then(stream => {
    document.getElementById('localVideo').srcObject = stream;
    stream.getTracks().forEach(track => peer.addTrack(track, stream));
  });

peer.ontrack = event => {
  document.getElementById('remoteVideo').srcObject = event.streams[0];
};

💡 Applications and Use Cases

Video conferencing and group meetings

Online tutoring or telemedicine

Real-time customer support systems

Live streaming and collaboration tools

🧱 Challenges and Solutions
Challenge	Solution
NAT/firewall traversal	Use STUN/TURN servers for connectivity
Connection reliability	Reconnect on ICE failure or signaling timeout
Bandwidth fluctuation	WebRTC’s adaptive bitrate control
Signaling complexity	Centralized WebSocket signaling server

🔒 Security Considerations

WebRTC uses DTLS/SRTP encryption by default.

WebSockets should always use WSS (Secure WebSocket) over HTTPS.

Avoid exposing ICE candidate details publicly.

🧾 Conclusion

This WebRTC Chat App demonstrates the synergy of WebRTC and WebSockets — enabling low-latency, secure, real-time communication between users.
By combining P2P media streaming with server-based signaling, it achieves both performance and scalability, forming the foundation for modern communication platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, and Discord.
